# Motion file saved by ICSPACE MotionTool
# File format version: 0.1
#
# First row: list of joints separated by ' ' used in this animation. See the H-Anim standard (http://www.web3d.org/documents/specifications/19774-1/V2.0/index.html) for hierarchy information.
# Other rows: Motion data with metadata. One row per frame: 
#   timestamp (ms, optional, 0 if not set.) followed by ','
#   root translation (x y z followed by ',')
#   joint rotations (w1 x1 y1 z1, w2 x2 y2 z2, ..., quaternions for each joint, local w.r.t hierarchy), followed by ','
#   joint translations (absolute w.r.t. to root of world, coordinates separated by ' ', data for each joint separated by ','. Finally followed by ';')
#   metadata: 
#	 e.g. MP:<MP>,PSPS:<PSPS>,Action:<ACTION>
#	 <MP>: list of movement segments. Typically list of: MotorAction-MotionSegment. Delimiter: ' '.
#	 <PSPS>: Style patterns. Typically pattern~confidence~intensity~intensityConfidence. Delimiter: ' '
#	 <ACTION>: Motor action. Often not set if already contained in <MP>
